Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Ross Taylor <ross.duncan.taylor@zoho.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: This package contains the qc() function for quantum clustering.
    The algorithm permits non-linear clustering which finds organic groupings
    of data powered by eigenfunctions and does not suffer from the curse of
    dimensionality.
